## Overview

Agents are specialized AI assistants with dedicated context windows, custom prompts, and specific tool access. They enable efficient problem-solving by delegating task-specific work to focused experts.

### Key Benefits

- **Context Preservation**: Each agent operates independently, keeping main conversation focused
- **Specialized Expertise**: Fine-tuned with detailed instructions for specific domains
- **Reusability**: Available across projects and shareable with team
- **Flexible Permissions**: Each agent can have different tool restrictions
- **Autonomous Selection**: Claude automatically selects appropriate agent based on task

### Agent Locations

- **Project agents**: `.claude/agents/` (team-shared via git, highest priority)
- **User agents**: `~/.claude/agents/` (personal, available across projects)
- **Plugin agents**: Bundled with installed plugins

## Agent Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Agents

Agents are most effective for:
- **Complex, multi-step tasks** requiring specialized knowledge
- **Large codebase exploration** where focused analysis is needed
- **Code reviews** requiring domain-specific expertise
- **Architecture decisions** benefiting from specialized patterns
- **Debugging** complex issues requiring deep analysis

### How to Invoke Agents

Agents can be invoked in several ways:

1. **Automatic Selection**: Claude automatically selects the appropriate agent based on task context
2. **Direct Invocation**: Use agent name in conversation (e.g., "Ask the java-security-expert...")
3. **Tool Selection**: When using the Task tool, specify the subagent_type parameter

4. **Address issues**: fix critical and high-priority items
5. **Re-review**: validate fixes

### Architecture Design Workflow

1. **Use software-architect agent** to design feature architecture
2. **Review with domain-specific architect** if needed
3. **Implement based on architecture blueprint**
4. **Validate with code-reviewer agent**

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Describe the issue** with error messages and context
2. **general-debugger agent** performs root cause analysis
3. **Proposes targeted fixes** with minimal changes
4. **Validate fixes** and re-test
